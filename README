README: Neural Network for MNIST Classification

Project Overview

This project implements a simple two-layer neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model processes 28x28 grayscale images (784 pixels) and predicts one of ten digit classes (0-9). The motivation? To justify adding COBOL to my CV.

Network Architecture

The neural network consists of:

Input layer: 784 neurons (one per pixel)

Hidden layer: 10 neurons with ReLU activation

Output layer: 10 neurons with softmax activation

The network is trained using a basic forward and backpropagation mechanism implemented in COBOL, because why not?

Training Details

Dataset: MNIST (train and test sets loaded from CSV files)

Training epochs: 5 (assuming patience holds)

Accuracy (so far):

Epoch 1: 88.48%

Epoch 2: 90.09%

Epoch 3: 90.90%

Epoch 4: 91.23%

Epoch 5: 91.47%

Running the Model

To run the model, ensure you have a functioning COBOL environment . Then, execute the following steps:

Compile the COBOL program.

Run the executable.
